    <p>Life was always a mystery to me. I never really figured out how to navigate this maze since I was a tiny seed.</p>
    <p>Life has always been so cold to me. I can feel myself freezing from head to toe as time proceeds.</p>
    <p>Life always felt like one of those puzzles, where pieces seem to change after it has finally been assembled.</p>
    <p>I keep living in my imagination because reality isn’t what it seems. I keep calling myself a new name every year to shake the fact that I’m growing old. I keep trying to walk my way through this den in which the lions have been let loose. I keep occupying myself with thoughts of a distant future that may never come true. I keep looking for love in places that don’t bear fruit. I keep trying to be kind as a way to find inner peace. I keep trying all these things while life keeps trying me. I keep running through so many paths; I guess I’ve reached the end of my trip.</p>
    <p>I guess life was never meant for me. I guess my heart was too pure for a world full of sin. I guess life was forever going to leave me in between. I guess life was always going to be like a movie, which I never got to see.</p>
    <p>We are all just strings in a melody. We are still all just seeds to a tree. We are all just underwater in this sea. We are all what we are; some say we are even what we eat. I guess I ate death cause this feels like purgatory.</p>
