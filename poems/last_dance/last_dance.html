    <p>Let me have this last dance with you. I could spin you around in your black dress. I can take your mind to a place where it’s never been. We could talk about all the kids that we never made. We could let the ballad play until the moon fades. My feet might cry, but my eyes will still stand. My eyes are on eggshells; just looking at your glare. I’ve been holding all the love for more than a hundred years. A hundred more nights & I’ll be on my deathbed.</p>
    <p>Let me have this last dance with you. I could spin you around in your black dress. I can take your mind to a place where it’s never been. We could talk about all the kids that we never made. We could let the ballad play until the moon fades. My feet might melt, but my soul is carved out of stone. My soul is bare-boned just staring at your glare. I’ve been holding all the love for more than a hundred years. A hundred more nights & I’ll be on my deathbed.</p>
    <p>The night feels like a stairway to heaven. I’m climbing the stairs, and the steps are feeling golden. If this is my last night, then I will surely rest in peace. Just promise me your photo will be placed beside my resting place.</p>
