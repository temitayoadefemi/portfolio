        <p class="poem">The universe always had me thinking,<br>
        It always had me wondering:<br>
        Why doesn't the sun fall?<br>
        And why does the moon follow me wherever I go?</p>
        
        <p class="poem">My thoughts wander, lost in a cubicle of my mind,<br>
        Intermingling, creating faults in my sight.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">Are we just drifting in space-time till we turn to dust?<br>
        Or is there more to us than is obvious?</p>
        
        <p class="poem">What is time? How do we know where we are?<br>
        It goes forward, but it feels like life is taking me backward.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I wish I knew when my time comes to an end,<br>
        To prepare, save some haze for the rainy days.<br>
        Play the guitar and listen to childhood songs,<br>
        Plan the days I play in my head before I lay.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">Life got me thinking: where is the balance?<br>
        The evil doesn't seem to be overcome by good anymore.<br>
        I read the scriptures & wonder why no flood descends,<br>
        Where has the love gone & where have our souls moored?</p>
        
        <p class="poem">Is life just a tragedy to teach us all a lesson?<br>
        Or is it a fairytale for those born and die pure?</p>
        
        <p class="poem">Show some faith and love, but questions remain:<br>
        Are we adrift, or is there a purpose in our human domain?</p>
