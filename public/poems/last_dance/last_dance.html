    <p class="poem">Let me have this last dance with you<br>
    I could spin you around in your black dress<br>
    I can take your mind to a place where it’s never been<br>
    We could talk about all the kids that we never made<br>
    We could let the ballad play until the moon fades<br>
    My feet might cry, but my eyes will still stand<br>
    My eyes are on eggshells; just looking at your glare<br>
    I’ve been holding all the love for more than a hundred years<br>
    A hundred more nights & I’ll be on my deathbed</p>

    <p class="poem">Let me have this last dance with you<br>
    I could spin you around in your black dress<br>
    I can take your mind to a place where it’s never been<br>
    We could talk about all the kids that we never made<br>
    We could let the ballad play until the moon fades<br>
    My feet might melt, but my soul is carved out of stone<br>
    My soul is bare-boned just staring at your glare<br>
    I’ve been holding all the love for more than a hundred years<br>
    A hundred more nights & I’ll be on my deathbed</p>

    <p class="poem">The night feels like a stairway to heaven<br>
    I’m climbing the stairs, and the steps are feeling golden<br>
    If this is my last night, then I will surely rest in peace<br>
    Just promise me your photo will be placed beside my resting place</p>
