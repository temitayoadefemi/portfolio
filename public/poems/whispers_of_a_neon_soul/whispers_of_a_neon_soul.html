        <p class="poem">Days are falling, the moon is wandering, the night starts stuttering. I sleep with a devil under my bed, so I gotta stay wondering. The demons are hungry, my night is a feast, where my mind is a buffet that the demons start pandering.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I wake up at midnight, not knowing what to do when the mind stops working. Back and forth we go till the mind's gone, and I wake up in the morning pondering, my eyes not working, my room distorting, as I search for a way to get life back to my worldview.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">The day repeats, falls even deeper — six feet deep — and it's trying to bring me under. The moon walks with me as I wander; it was my only friend for the summer. I look at the stars, the sky is less blue, the color getting dimmer. The night runs away before I can say my words and get her number.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I sleep with the lights on, as more demons enter my room, and I'm losing track of their number. My mind is laid on a plate as a feast, they force into my consciousness like I'm around Cassandra Nova. I wake up with numb legs; I stand, but my soul is still under. The day falls deeper — I might soon go to the place where the demons come from.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I look around, and all I see is the night coming sooner. I try to smile, I try to laugh, I try to talk, but my face is still numb. I guess all the days and nights I've been running from are starting to get very long. I lose track of time, lose track of self, trying to find where I belong.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I guess I never knew who I was since the day I left the womb. As a young child, all I wanted was to belong. But now we've grown up, and I'm stuck inside a place where there is no one.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I'm having these thoughts as the night is still young. My mind is so depleted, this might be my last one. The demons are growing in numbers, and I'm starting to see bats and a few worms.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">These sweet dreams turn to nightmares — I'm gonna need some fairy dust. Night is getting old, midnight's crawling more. I'm scared to close my eyes, even with the lights still on.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I look around and see all that I've lost; I look inside and see where there is more. I stop and pause, putting some faith into the Lord. I say a prayer, the one my mum taught me when I was young.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I see the dark turning light, the bats losing their sight. I see the love in her eyes, feel the pain leave my heart. I see the demons going wild, crawling out of my life. I see a dream in my heart, a tear fall from an eye.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I see a path in my life, I see the night come alive. I see rainbows and rollercoasters. I see joyrides at the park side. I see a future love life, the beach and a sunrise.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I see my life come alive; I think I can now close my eyes. The dawn is coming soon — a life I once knew. I lay in my bed for the last time, turning off the bright lights.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I can feel my face now, and I try to crack a smile. I dust off my pillow and tell myself, "Good night."</p>
