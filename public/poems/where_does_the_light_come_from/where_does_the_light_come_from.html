    <h4>Where Does The Light Come From?</h4>
    <img src="./the_light.jpeg" alt="Where Does The Light Come From?" class="img-fluid rounded">

    <p class="poem">Where does the light from our souls come from?<br>
    Are our souls infrared or glowing in the dark?<br>
    Even white light changes when passed through a prism,<br>
    As a child is altered by life’s prison-like arc.</p>

    <p class="poem">My soul might be a mix of many hues,<br>
    Wrapped in a coat, let the envies shine bright.<br>
    I might be sold tonight, then crowned anew,<br>
    Let Pharaohs know my brothers have the light.</p>

    <p class="poem">That’s the dimmed light, needing objects moved,<br>
    To reveal its brilliance, long subdued.<br>
    On the fourth day, God made light, it’s proved,<br>
    But when came darkness, where demons brood?</p>

    <p class="poem">When did He craft the darkness of midnight?<br>
    The shadows where evil spirits reside?<br>
    The blackness I see with eyes shut tight?<br>
    The void that surrounds us when we’ve died?</p>

    <p class="poem">They say at death, we see only light,<br>
    A guide to lead us to heavenly heights.<br>
    Angels aglow, too bright to behold,<br>
    As our lives before us swiftly unfold.</p>

    <p class="poem">The Lord passes judgment, our deeds in sight,<br>
    That’s the day we all see the light.<br>
    But what of those who’ve lived in shade?<br>
    Will their souls, too, be light-arrayed?</p>

    <p class="poem">Perhaps the light and dark intertwine,<br>
    Two sides of a coin, both divine.<br>
    Our souls are a canvas of shadow and glow,<br>
    A masterpiece only the Creator can know.</p>

    <p class="poem">So let us embrace both darkness and light,<br>
    For in their balance, we find our might.<br>
    Our souls are complex, a spectrum so vast,<br>
    Shining through prisms of the future and past.</p>
