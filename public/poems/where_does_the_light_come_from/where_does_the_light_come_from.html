        <h1>Where Does The Light Come From?</h1>
        <img src="./the_light.jpeg" alt="Where Does The Light Come From?" class="featured-image">
        
        <p class="poem">Where does the light from our souls come from?<br>
        Are our souls infrared or glowing in the dark?<br>
        Even white light changes when passed through a prism,<br>
        As a child is altered by life's prison-like arc.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">My soul might be a mix of many hues,<br>
        Wrapped in a coat, let the envies shine bright.<br>
        I might be sold tonight, then crowned anew,<br>
        Let Pharaohs know my brothers have the light.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">That's the dimmed light, needing objects moved,<br>
        To reveal its brilliance, long subdued.<br>
        On the fourth day, God made light, it's proved,<br>
        But when came darkness, where demons brood?</p>
        
        <p class="poem">When did He craft the darkness of midnight?<br>
        The shadows where evil spirits reside?<br>
        The blackness I see with eyes shut tight?<br>
        The void that surrounds us when we've died?</p>
        
        <p class="poem">They say at death, we see only light,<br>
        A guide to lead us to heavenly heights.<br>
        Angels aglow, too bright to behold,<br>
        As our lives before us swiftly unfold.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">The Lord passes judgment, our deeds in sight,<br>
        That's the day we all see the light.<br>
        But what of those who've lived in shade?<br>
        Will their souls, too, be light-arrayed?</p>
        
        <p class="poem">Perhaps the light and dark intertwine,<br>
        Two sides of a coin, both divine.<br>
        Our souls are a canvas of shadow and glow,<br>
        A masterpiece only the Creator can know.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">So let us embrace both darkness and light,<br>
        For in their balance, we find our might.<br>
        Our souls are complex, a spectrum so vast,<br>
        Shining through prisms of the future and past.</p>
