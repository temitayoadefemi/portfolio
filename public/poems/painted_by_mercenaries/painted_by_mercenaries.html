    <div class="poem">
        <p class="line">Mercenaries painted the walls I’ve been living in.<br>
        They painted these walls in their last days when the war came.<br>
        I still smell the bloodstains on the floor;<br>
        The water has a metallic taste that feels warm.<br>
        They built their last cage for a golden mind –</p>

        <p class="line">A mind that could hear the walls speak<br>
        And understand the hidden messages relayed in the colors they picked.<br>
        They also laid the foundation and layered the walls.</p>

        <p class="line">The architecture feels like something out of a safe haven,<br>
        Where birds can only squeak at the windows but never get in,<br>
        And crows can caw, but the sound will never get through.</p>

        <p class="line">Maybe these walls are bulletproof – I wouldn’t know;<br>
        I’ve never seen a gun. Or maybe I do know.<br>
        Perhaps these are thoughts from a past life.<br>
        When PTSD lay buried within, waiting for a quick awakening.<br>
        When the nights passed so fast, time felt like it was distilling.</p>

        <p class="line">But one thing I know:<br>
        The walls are speaking, the paint is drying, the ceiling is melting,<br>
        The mirrors are deflecting, the light is trapped in a prism,<br>
        The days are getting darker, and the nights turn into a bright pyramid.</p>

        <p class="line">I know there are things I don’t know.<br>
        I know I’m still too young to hope.<br>
        The architect of this home is archived within my soul.</p>

        <p class="line">I need to know. And I think I know the story,<br>
        But the memories are buried beneath.<br>
        Why am I in this home? Who built this dome?<br>
        Is it a prison to keep me safe or a home to keep me away?</p>

        <p class="line">I know the walls speak, but I never understood the language.<br>
        I know the paint is drying, but it’s still beautiful to me.<br>
        I know the ceiling is melting, but the liquid never stained me.<br>
        I know the mirrors are deflecting, but I still see my face on my screen.<br>
        The light might be stuck in a prism, but I’m stuck in it too.<br>
        The days are dark, but I’ve still got my glasses.<br>
        The bright pyramid isn’t the worst place to be.</p>

        <p class="line">We are all sand in this universe.<br>
        We still don’t know where we are.<br>
        We still don’t know how it came about.<br>
        I might be at war, or I might be at peace –<br>
        But home is always where I am, no matter the bloodstains beneath my feet.</p>
