        <p class="poem">When the moon cries, when gravity pulls us apart,<br>
        The space-time continuum will forever fuse to one<br>
        Because of the energy we’ve pulled from our souls.</p>

        <p class="poem">The dark days will forever be bright<br>
        Because of the light deep within our souls.<br>
        We will live forever; our flesh may remain underground,<br>
        But love will merge our minds into the beyond.</p>

        <p class="poem">The days I cried for this love will forever be yearned for<br>
        Because of the humidity it bore within our hearts.<br>
        In the days when love was sour,<br>
        All I could taste were the metals from the open wounds.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">The days when I could see beneath my feet<br>
        Because the planet was spiraling beyond its roots.<br>
        On the days when life was rough, I could hear my soul squeak.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">The days when I was too young to see beyond my six feet.<br>
        Those days taught me that the love we share goes way beyond Earth.<br>
        If we fly too close to the sun tonight, Icarus would never have been born.<br>
        If we stay up until the morning light, the dusk will never become dawn.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">If we were still those kids,<br>
        We would paint the same strawberry swing.<br>
        If we had been just as we were,<br>
        The love would have never gotten this deep.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">I want the love I feel when I look and see your eyes.<br>
        I want the love I feel when I’m lost inside your mind.<br>
        That was forever pure, and I’m sure it will be forever.<br>
        If it doesn’t last, I’ll pour acid on it and make sure it burns.</p>
        
        <p class="poem">Forever it will burn,<br>
        Forever it will burn,<br>
        Forever it will burn,<br>
        Forever it will always be pure.</p>
