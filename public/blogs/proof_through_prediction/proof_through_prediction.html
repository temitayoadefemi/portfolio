        <h1>Proof Through Prediction</h1>
        <img src="./proof_through_prediction.png" alt="What is Intuition and what happens at a subconscious level?" class="featured-image">
        
        <p>Understanding how we predict improbable events can offer valuable insights into the nature of intuition. Examining my thinking in relation to the sequential nature of time has allowed me to gain some insights. In mathematics, we can always write proofs for our theorems, craft equations for our theories, and develop mathematical frameworks that help us comprehend and understand the universe we inhabit. However, even though our environment is inherently mathematical – the progression of events through time, the movement of bodies, facial reactions, the behaviors of biological systems – it remains difficult to prove things in nature.</p>
        
        <p>For example, suppose someone went into a building – you see the person walk in, and you see the person walk out. If you were the only one who witnessed this, how would you prove to the next person that you saw it? The person could decide not to believe you or not to take you seriously; it's not like you can write equations to prove your observation.</p>
        
        <p>Some individuals are blessed with intuition; they just know things that happen in their environment. But when asked to prove it, they don't really know how because they don't know how they know it. This intuitive knowledge, often dismissed as mere gut feeling, actually represents a sophisticated pattern recognition system operating at a subconscious level.</p>
        
        <p>I've been practicing metacognition, and I think I understand why intuitive individuals know things in relation to their environment. I believe it has to do with the linear progression and sequences of events. One thing I've realized is that nothing happens in isolation – if an event occurs, another event follows because of it, and this chain continues like a recursive loop. The universe is reactive rather than proactive. The reason you know something is because of the event that caused it, and the subsequent events that keep happening just reaffirm the intuition.</p>
        
        <p>This cascade of events creates a web of causality that intuitive individuals seem to navigate instinctively, picking up on subtle connections and patterns that others might miss. But the main question still remains: How do you prove it? We cannot map the entirety of the universe with contextual variables on a supercomputer to simulate events; even if we could, it's going to be a long time until we have a supercomputer that capable.</p>
        
        <p>But I have a different idea. We all know that no one can actually predict the future (as of now), so the only way you can actually prove environmental events is if you continuously predict the future – but not just simply predict the future, but predict a very unlikely future.</p>
        
        <p>For example, let's say you have a friend who consistently predicts the scores of football matches. Perhaps they accurately predict common outcomes like 1–0 games, 2–1 games, or 1–1 draws – not always, but with notable consistency. You might attribute this to luck. However, if that same friend starts consistently predicting unusual scores like an 8–2 game, a 5–1 game, or a 4–4 draw in very unlikely scenarios, it's clear that your friend is no longer just lucky.</p>
        
        <p>At this point, you might conclude that they have deeper context about these games – perhaps knowledge about match-fixing, underlying dynamics within the teams, or other subjective insights. The statistical improbability of consistently predicting such outlier events becomes its own form of proof – one that's harder to dismiss than traditional evidence.</p>
        
        <p>Let's take another example: someone winning the lottery. Winning once can be chalked up to luck and randomness – it's extremely rare. But if I want to prove or at least convince you that it was not random and not by chance, and I say that the person will win the lottery again, and then they do, that not only convinces you that it's not by chance but also adds another layer to the story. It suggests I have some context about the situation and I'm not just making baseless claims.</p>
        
        <p>This principle extends beyond games of chance – it applies to predicting market crashes, technological breakthroughs, or even personal life events. The key lies not in the prediction itself but in the specificity and improbability of the predicted outcome.</p>
        
        <p>I believe that if we want to prove things within our environment, we have to follow this ideology. There is a mathematical framework that can emerge from this, which could possibly verify such claims. We need to be able to predict an unlikely future before it happens, with a consistency that would be impossible without context.</p>
        
        <p>What is considered impossible depends on the individual you're trying to convince or prove it to. Although this is variable, humans typically operate on this axis with minimal variations – we generally agree on what constitutes an improbable event versus a merely unlikely one.</p>
        
        <p>This framework could revolutionize how we think about proof in real-world scenarios. Instead of relying solely on traditional evidence or mathematical proofs, we could develop a system that quantifies the improbability of accurate predictions over time. This would create a new standard of evidence – one that bridges the gap between intuitive knowledge and empirical proof.</p>
        
        <p>In fields like finance, someone who accurately predicts rare market events consistently may demonstrate an underlying understanding of market dynamics that isn't apparent through traditional analysis. In medicine, a doctor who reliably diagnoses rare conditions based on subtle symptoms could be tapping into an advanced pattern recognition capability.</p>
        
        <p>The challenge going forward will be to formalize this framework – to develop mathematical models that can quantify the improbability of correct predictions and establish thresholds for what constitutes proof. While this won't replace traditional scientific methods, it could complement them, especially in areas where conventional proof is difficult or impossible to obtain.</p>
        
        <p>This new paradigm of proof through improbable prediction could open up entirely new avenues for understanding and validating our knowledge of complex, dynamic systems. By recognizing and quantifying these abilities, we can harness intuition in a more systematic way, potentially leading to breakthroughs in various disciplines. This approach acknowledges that, while we may not always be able to articulate the reasoning behind certain insights, their consistent accuracy in predicting unlikely events serves as a powerful form of proof in itself.</p>
        
        <p>By following this approach, we can begin to bridge the gap between intuitive knowledge and empirical evidence, offering a new perspective on how we understand and interact with the world around us.</p>
