    <p>When we dive into research, and start reading and watching videos about the early days of life as far as we can remember, we hear about the Stone Age days, even stories and ideas about some creatures which inhabited the earth in ancient times. The stories evolve as you peel back time further.</p>
    <p>You hear stories about Aristotle, Socrates, and even how Galileo told the whole world that the earth wasn’t the center of the universe, and they condemned him. We continue to hear stories about the great minds and thinkers such as Isaac Newton, and how he laid the foundation of mathematics and mechanics. These stories grow on us, and we are inspired by those days, and our parents encourage us to leave a mark and lead a life that would be regarded and respected.</p>
    <p>We hear stories and concepts about the lives and individuals in those days, with comments about if someone time-traveled to the past with a phone, the person would be burned alive, and it’s probably true. We talk about how individuals traveled and moved around on horses and camels. We even have medieval shows and movies such as ‘Game of Thrones,’ painting us a vivid picture of how those times would have probably been, and we enjoy these musings and imagine ourselves as a medieval being.</p>
    <p>We are in the age of artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, smartphones, and other amazing inventions which nobody would have thought of in the medieval times. Technology is so advanced currently that individuals don’t even have to leave their habitat to engage with the world on a high level. We can order any item and communicate with anyone within the confines of our homes, and we still have thinkers and innovators suggesting that the singularity is near.</p>
    <p>Ray Kurzweil has written several books about the Singularity, and even has a new book coming out, claiming that the singularity is nearer. Well, the singularity has come a long time ago, and we are too busy fantasizing about a utopian future to realize we are currently living in the singularity.</p>
    <p>The singularity happened when Lawrence Page and Sergei Brin released their paper for Google. The singularity happened when Claude Shannon showed us that there is a mathematical formula for communication. The singularity happened when Steve Jobs took the stage and showed us the iPhone, and currently, in 2024, it feels like the singularity is happening every day, but we keep chasing a singularity which we would never get, because of the expectations of humans and their ambitions.</p>
    <p>We talk about augmenting our lives with machines in the future, but we have ignored the fact that we are already augmented with machines. We have our computers, smartphones, smartwatches, and in no time, Neuralink would put chips in our brains to allow us to interact with computations on a high and low level.</p>
    <p>The Singularity is not happening in 2029. The Singularity already happened.</p>
