    <h4>The Evolution of Computing: Software is Far from Dead</h4>
    <img src="./future_of_software.png" alt="Evolution of Software" class="img-fluid rounded">
    <p>The evolution of the computing age can still be traced to Moore’s Law, in which the cofounder of Intel, Gordon Moore, observed that the number of transistors on a chip doubled every two years. Although this observation has slightly swayed in recent years, it has stood the test of time for decades, driving technological advancements at an unprecedented pace.</p>
    <p>This fundamental principle drove technology as we know it, creating wealth, prosperity, and enterprise, fostering companies that provided immense value by augmenting our talents with hardware and software that make us more efficient and productive. We witnessed pivotal moments in tech history: we saw the paper for PageRank, which launched Google; we saw Bill Gates and Paul Allen team up to form Microsoft; we also saw the rapid expansion of Facebook, which was launched by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm room; we saw Steve Jobs take the stage to present the iPhone, which astounded the crowd and created a whole new wave and paradigm of mobile computing.</p>
    <p>These milestones underscore the transformative power of software in shaping modern society and business landscapes. We’ve seen other critical and crucial moments in software development throughout the years, each pushing the boundaries of what’s possible. We are currently at a time in 2024 when there is no task we could think of performing in which there is no software to augment our ability to perform the task without some edge cases, of course. That is how far we have come in software evolution.</p>
    <p>However, a new narrative has emerged with the rise of artificial intelligence tools like Large Language Models, AI Agents, AI assistants, etc. The new favorite headline on each blog, forum, or topic is “Software is Dead.” This bold claim has sparked debates across the tech industry and beyond.</p>
    <p>My question is: how, when, and why is Software dead? How is it possible that the rise of these tools is bringing software to its doom? Aren’t these tools composed of software components? Do we not need servers to deploy Large Language Models? Don’t you also need code to write a Large Language Model? Or is something missing, and I’ve lost track of time living under a rock?</p>
    <p>The truth is, software is not dead; it is as alive as ever. I believe we are entering the golden age of software, when its reach and impact will be more profound than ever.</p>
    <p>Consider this: Every phone, desktop, robot, and tablet needs an operating system. What is that made of? Software. Every AI agent needs to have a compass for how it will navigate its environment, and we code it using software. With the rise of AI and virtual reality, we will see a new wave shift in software applications and development.</p>
    <p>We will have software on our eyes with Virtual Reality Glasses because you need software to bring it to life. We will have software in our kitchens with robot assistants helping us with basic tasks such as cleaning the dishes and vacuuming. We will have software on our chests with tools such as Humane AI Pin, to help us navigate and stay updated. AI will bring software everywhere, and it will not be limited to a small number of devices such as our phones and tablets.</p>
    <p>There will be software everywhere, and this will only evolve as time passes. Just as the iPhone introduced us to mobile apps, who knows what the future holds? We might need to start writing apps for our robots to make them do tasks that aren’t generally programmed. We might need new apps for our AI Pin to do tasks that aren’t pre-programmed. This will have a ripple effect and take software to a new dimension that it hasn’t previously explored.</p>
    <p>Integrating AI and software will produce more sophisticated, intuitive, and robust applications across various sectors. From healthcare to education, entertainment to scientific research, software will continue to be the backbone of technological progress.</p>
    <p>So the next time someone tells you software is dead, tell them, “No, software is just getting started.” We are on the brink of a new era in software development, where the possibilities are limitless, and the innovation potential is more significant than ever. The future of software is not just alive — it’s thriving and evolving in ways we’re only beginning to imagine.</p>
