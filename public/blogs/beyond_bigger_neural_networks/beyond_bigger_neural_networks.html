<h1>Beyond Bigger Neural Networks</h1>
<img src="./beyond_bigger_neural_networks.png" alt="Beyond Bigger Neural Networks" class="featured-image">
    <p>Since the release of ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence industry has experienced unprecedented growth, with tech stocks skyrocketing and governments actively participating in AI initiatives. Recently, the announcement of the Stargate project, estimated at 500 billion dollars, demonstrates the widespread commitment and passion toward creating safe artificial general intelligence (AGI) and superintelligence. However, there are several elephants in the room that many stakeholders are not currently addressing.</p>
    <p>We must ask serious questions: Is this the right approach to creating intelligence? Isn’t our current methodology fundamentally flawed? Can we continue to increase capabilities simply by training more extensive neural networks, or is there a limit? These are profound questions that demand our attention.</p>
    <p>We cannot create AGI or ASI merely by training increasingly larger neural networks with expert data. While capabilities would undoubtedly increase, true AGI – an artificial intelligence system that can perform any human task – remains beyond reach. Consider what happens when an AI system encounters a novel problem without traces in its training dataset. While it might still attempt to reason about the situation, its capabilities would be significantly limited.</p>
    <p>We must return to the drawing board and examine how we can create intelligence. While deep learning remains the answer, given that our brain structure is based on a neural network, it shouldn’t require hundreds of millions of dollars to train these systems. Humans can typically reason about novel problems we haven’t encountered before. We possess creativity, agency, and an innate understanding of probability that makes us unique – qualities these large language models lack.</p>
    <p>The fundamental challenge we face is not just about scaling up our current approaches but rather understanding the core principles of intelligence itself; we need to define intelligence and understand what it means to be intelligent in order to allow us to create intelligence. I believe currently, large language models are doing nothing else than sophisticated pattern recognition. While large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing and generating human-like text, they still lack the fundamental attributes that make human intelligence remarkable: proper understanding, causal reasoning, and the ability to create novel solutions to unprecedented problems.</p>
    <p>Consider how a child learns – they don’t need massive datasets or billions of parameters. Instead, they learn through exploration, trial and error, and building mental models of how the world works. They can generalize from a few examples and apply knowledge across domains in ways our current AI systems cannot match. This suggests we’re missing something fundamental in our approach to artificial intelligence.</p>
    <p>We may need to integrate multiple approaches combining the pattern-recognition strengths of deep learning with symbolic reasoning, causal modeling, and insights from cognitive science and neuroscience. We need to develop systems that can build their internal models of the world rather than just processing patterns in training data.</p>
    <p>This isn’t to say that our current progress isn’t valuable. However, we need to be honest about the limitations of our current approach and open to exploring alternative paths. The path to AGI shouldn’t be just about who can build the biggest model or process the most data but who can unlock the fundamental principles of intelligence itself.</p>
    <p>The future of AI development might not lie in massive data centers and billion-dollar training runs but in more elegant solutions that better mirror how natural intelligence works. We must remain ambitious and humble, recognizing that the path to accurate artificial general intelligence might differ from the one we’re currently on.</p>
