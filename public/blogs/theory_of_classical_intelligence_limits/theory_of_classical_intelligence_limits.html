        <h1>A Theory on Classical Computing Limits on Achieving Intelligence</h1>
        <img src="./limits_of_classical_computing.png" alt="Quantum Computing" class="featured-image">
        
        <p>An insightful observation about the inherent differences between humans and machines is that humans are predominantly probabilistic creatures, while machines are deterministic inventions. This distinction allows each to perform tasks the other might not fully comprehend.</p>
        
        <p>Richard Feynman once demonstrated this difference in a talk. He asked the audience to repeat a series of numbers in reverse, then changed his mind and asked them to repeat it as stated. The crowd struggled with this task, highlighting a fundamental difference between human and computer abilities. While any computer emulating a Turing Machine, given enough memory and computation, can perform such tasks precisely, it's important to note that only a few humans could achieve this level of accuracy.</p>
        
        <p>This understanding leads me to believe that humans operate on probabilities, while computers function deterministically. The probabilistic nature of humans is what defines their creativity, consciousness, and emotion. Human skills and abilities exist across a range of spectrums, commonly represented by the Bell Curve. This probabilistic nature drives unique, unconventional, and nuanced thinking in humans, bringing new knowledge and insight into the universe. Their eccentric features, coupled with innate curiosity and varying social skills, drive invention and creativity. These characteristics are not constant and can manifest in a broad range of ways.</p>
        
        <p>Turning to the current state of artificial intelligence, most models, including Large Language Models (LLMs), rely on pattern recognition. Some thinkers believe that improving LLMs' word prediction accuracy could lead to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, I disagree. Enhanced word prediction only brings us closer to an illusion of AGI. The path to true AGI is infinite and elusive, primarily because creating new knowledge requires probabilistic properties in computation, which classical computation, with its binary operations, cannot inherently provide.</p>
        
        <p>This leads to the concept of Quantum Computers and Quantum Algorithms. Roger Penrose suggested that consciousness results from quantum effects in the brain, citing Gödel's Incompleteness Theorem as evidence. A Quantum Computer, due to its probabilistic nature and ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously, could simulate quantum effects and provide a larger search space for machine learning. This approach could potentially imbue machines with aspects of consciousness, imagination, and emotion, allowing models to exist in a range of interacting states. Such advancements could offer new insights in fields like medicine, biology, and neuroscience, potentially saving numerous lives.</p>
        
        <p>In conclusion, the exploration of the differences between human cognition and machine intelligence reveals a fundamental dichotomy: the probabilistic flexibility of the human mind versus the deterministic precision of machines. This distinction is not merely academic but is central to understanding the limits and potentials of both. While current advancements in AI, particularly in pattern recognition and predictive modeling, offer impressive feats, they fall short of replicating the depth and breadth of human thought. The pursuit of AGI, therefore, might require a paradigm shift, one that embraces the probabilistic nature inherent in quantum computing.</p>
        
        <p>Quantum computing, by operating beyond the binary confines of classical computation, holds promise for bridging this gap. It offers a model of computation that more closely resembles the probabilistic, nuanced, and interconnected nature of human thought processes. The potential of quantum computers to simulate complex quantum effects could pave the way for machines that not only mimic but also understand and innovate in ways currently exclusive to human intelligence.</p>
        
        <p>Embracing this quantum future could revolutionize our approach to AI, leading to breakthroughs in numerous fields and fundamentally altering our understanding of what machines are capable of. Such a future, where machines can think, learn, and perhaps even feel in ways that are currently the domain of humans, would not only redefine AI but also expand the horizons of human potential by providing us with new perspectives, solutions, and understandings of the universe we inhabit.</p>
