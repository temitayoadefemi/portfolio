    <p>We often get terrified when we hear a new concept, whether a maths, physics, or computer science concept, which we think is too abstract. We tell ourselves that there is no possible way we could learn this, but the thing is that we are much more intelligent than we think we are. Most of us have been learning things incorrectly, or we had terrible teachers who never taught us how to understand correctly. Any new concept we hear, we try to memorize the information and shove it into our minds without understanding how this new knowledge connects with previous knowledge and are hopeful that it will come up in the next tutorial session, test, or exam, but that is the wrong way to learn. There are better ways in which we can understand abstract concepts.</p>
    <p>Richard Feynman once gave a lecture in which he went from counting numbers to calculus in 4 pages. This is extraordinary, showing he understood mathematics from a primary and elementary level, similar to going from logic gates to socket programming or from atoms to any physical object. He could do this because this information wasn’t memorized but understood at a core level. One realization I’ve had is that every concept we learn is just built upon previous concepts with added layers of abstractions, making it challenging to realize, but once you peel back the layers of abstractions, you recognize the fundamental notion of the idea and begin adding back the layers of abstractions understanding how each layer contributes to the original concept and is the rationale on Feynman can go from numbers to calculus within four pages.</p>
    <p>Consider the seven OSI layers in computer science, which shows the build-up of how data is transmitted to be able to be viewed on a web page by building upon layers of abstraction & that’s the right way to learn about internet data transmission by peeling back the layers of abstraction and viewing the concept as whole rather than divided, and actually to start learning it as whole, we have to start from the bottom layer, and that’s often the problem we mostly have when we try to learn new things, we try to see them as separated elements rather than whole concepts.</p>
    <p>Mathematics is a whole concept, and each piece of knowledge builds upon previous knowledge; you cannot learn calculus without algebra, you cannot learn trigonometry without having a basic understanding of shapes and their features, and if you try to understand these concepts without their foundation, you often end up memorising information without a clear thesis on how the information fits into previous knowledge. You need to remember what you learned or know how to apply the concept to unfamiliar problems.</p>
    <p>This approach of understanding concepts from their foundations and seeing how they build upon each other is more comprehensive than just mathematics or computer science. It applies to virtually every field of study. In biology, for instance, understanding complex ecosystems becomes much easier when you start with the basic principles of how individual organisms function and interact. That is how DeepMind solved the protein folding problem—still understanding how these fundamental proteins interact and building upon the previous knowledge of those previously explored. This also applies to literature; grasping complex narratives and themes is more achievable with a solid foundation in basic storytelling structures and literary devices.</p>
    <p>The key is approaching learning with curiosity and a willingness to explore the underlying principles. Intelligence would take you far in life, but curiosity and inquisitiveness would take you farther. Instead of asking, “What do I need to memorize for the test?” we should be asking, “How does this concept work?” and “Why is it important?”. This shift in mindset can transform learning from a chore into an exciting journey of discovery and allow you to apply the principles to domains that are even beyond your test’s scope.</p>
    <p>Moreover, this learning method — understanding concepts from their core and seeing how they build upon each other — helps better retain information and apply knowledge creatively to solve new problems. When you know a concept from its foundations, you’re better equipped to use that knowledge flexibly, make connections between different ideas, and innovate. So, the next time you learn something, never try to memorize it; always question its core foundations.</p>
    <p>Remember, the goal of education should not be to accumulate facts but to develop a deep understanding that allows us to see the world in new ways. You shouldn’t retain information in every book you read. Instead, it should reshape your worldview. Albert Einstein once said, “Education is not the learning of facts, but the training of the mind to think.” By focusing on understanding rather than memorization, we can train our minds to think more effectively and creatively, unlocking our full potential as learners and problem-solvers.</p>
