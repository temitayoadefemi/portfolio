        <h1>Life as a Computational Abstraction</h1>
        <img src="./computational_abstraction.png" alt="Abstract Representation of Computational Processes" class="featured-image">
        
        <p>I've recently stumbled upon several interrelated concepts, which have intrigued me by suggesting that humans might be a form of computation. Andrej Karpathy has described neural networks as a "mathematical abstraction of the brain," which is a precise and compelling depiction. This description sparks the question: if we can mathematically abstract the brain, does this not imply that something inherently mathematical and computational is occurring within the human body? Such reasoning could lend credibility to Nick Bostrom's simulation hypothesis.</p>
        
        <p>The components that constitute the human body are also subjects of curiosity. Are they atoms or dust? Or is dust merely composed of atoms? If humans are a form of computation, this could enhance our understanding of consciousness and emotion. Such insights could lead to breakthroughs in AGI, neuroscience, and psychology and could also provide a more profound knowledge of our universe.</p>
        
        <p>The concept of Turing Complete Machines has also informed my perspective. It's plausible that our bodies are Turing complete machines, transmitting instructions in a type of code — electronic signals — that we do not fully comprehend. In this context, our genes might be comparable to the initial weights set in a machine-learning model. These 'genetic weights' could interact with other body elements, causing certain reactions and behaviors. Perhaps the combination of these 'weights' and parameters is passed down to our offspring. This could explain why some traits and behaviors are hereditary and why an individual's offspring may not always exhibit the same behavior but often exist within the same spectrum.</p>
        
        <p>These are profoundly critical questions that warrant further exploration and research. By probing these queries, we open the door to a new world of understanding — both of ourselves and of the universe. We stand at the frontier of a new kind of knowledge, one that merges computation with biology, and mathematics with emotion. As we continue to explore, we should remember that our bodies, our minds, and even our emotions might be more similar to a complex mathematical computation than we have ever dared to believe.</p>
