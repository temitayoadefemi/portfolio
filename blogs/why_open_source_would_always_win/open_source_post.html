    <p>The origins of open-source software can be traced back to Richard Stallman’s frustration with enterprise software. The idea that he had software he couldn’t edit and manipulate to his own will severely frustrated him, giving rise to the open-source movement.</p>
    <p>Open source has created foundational tools that we use and enjoy. Its most important creation is the Linux operating system, which is used in over 95% of data centers worldwide. We’ve seen all influential and renowned programming languages go open source, starting with Perl, created by Larry Wall in 1987. Up to this present age, in 2024, we have open-source languages like Python, Golang, and Rust, to name a few. To the extent that a programmer wouldn’t dare touch a programming language or a framework if it isn’t open-sourced.</p>
    <p>Open source flourished and continues to flourish. If you’re an amazing engineer with amazing googling and research skills, there isn’t anything you can’t build while leveraging open source tools. The tools are amazing, and the community is wonderful.</p>
    <p>We all know that the progress of society is due to open source. It gives a chance for visionaries and talented individuals on the underdeveloped side of the globe to pick up a system, install an open-source operating system, install an open-source IDE, and start making their dreams come true. Individuals, companies, governments, and hospitals all leverage open source tools.</p>
    <p>One of the main driving factors in the rise of artificial intelligence is the nature of the research, which is open source. Companies, individuals, and students collaborate to create amazing research that drives artificial intelligence forward. That’s how we got the ImageNet paper, the Transformer architecture, and eventually ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and other amazing AI tools.</p>
    <p>However, recently, these frontier companies are no longer publishing research on their findings, and the community doesn’t feel as open any more. The Gemini paper had no technical details; the GPT-4 paper had no technical information. Currently, we don’t know much of the technical infrastructure and architecture of these frontier models. The only company that is providing us with technical information about the technicalities of their models is Meta, which is one of the only big tech companies still releasing open-source models.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that these companies that do not publish their research and do not release open-source models are under the belief that closed models are going to be the ones that win at the end of the day. But they are entirely wrong. No matter how much these big tech companies want to hide the details behind their models, the details will still be out. No matter how much these companies want to stop the open-source AI movement, it will still flourish because 100,000 men will always overpower 500 men. The whole world working together is only going to overpower one company. These individuals in those companies are talented, but there are more gifted people outside those companies than in them because the world is whole of talent.</p>
    <p>This collective force of global intelligence and creativity that thrives in an open environment makes open source a programming ethos and a revolutionary movement. The value of open-source software and the global force behind it can never be underestimated; its ability to evolve with the contributions of a worldwide community ensures that it remains adaptable, innovative, and accessible.</p>
    <p>In the context of technological advancement, open-source projects like TensorFlow, Kubernetes, and Apache Hadoop have become the backbone of modern computing, serving industries ranging from data analytics to cloud computing; these projects benefit from the contributions of diverse minds that help refine their functionality and extend their applicability, these diverse minds work tenaciously to ensure that innovation continues mostly without pay for their contributions, showing the beauty of the human spirit.</p>
    <p>Moreover, the principles of open source extend beyond software. They imbue a philosophy of collaboration and transparency, setting a standard for how knowledge can be shared and built upon. This philosophy has accelerated innovations in various fields, including medicine, engineering, and environmental science, and will continue to do so as long as the human journey continues.</p>
    <p>As we look to the future, the trajectory of open source is clear. Its ethos of openness, combined with the relentless drive of a worldwide community, will continue to be a critical factor in solving some of the world’s most pressing problems. While proprietary models may provide short-term gains for some companies, the enduring success of technological advancements relies on community, collaboration, and the free exchange of ideas.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, the legacy of open source is not just in its code but in its community. It is a testament to the power of collective effort and the belief that technology should be a democratizing force. No matter the obstacles put forth by entities that favor closed ecosystems, the spirit of open source is designed to thrive on collaboration and innovation. This spirit, supported by millions of individuals working together, will continue to lead the charge in technological innovation and remain a beacon of progress.</p>
